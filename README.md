# FILE-TRANSFER-USING-UDP
“File Transfer using UDP” is a computer networks project that aims to provide a
confidential file transfer system that allows a user to transfer files with security
encryption. It is a password system where there are 3 clients and one server.
Information exchanges are made through sockets using FTP protocol. The FTP
protocol ensures the security of the transfer of files from one client to another. That
way, a user/client can be rest assured of the data in their files being protected from a
third party system.
